AlternateIcons is a Swift script that automates adding alternate app icons to your iOS app. Group your alternate icons inside an asset catalog, add a build phase and let the script set up your app. No more manual maintenance required!

## Installation

### From a Pre-built Archive

You can download a pre-compiled binary for the version you want to install in the [Releases](https://github.com/alexaubry/alternate-icons/releases) section of this repository.

Once the archive is expanded, run the `install.sh` script to install the script on your system.

### From Source

You can build and install AlternateIcons from source using **Make**:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/alexaubry/alternate-icons.git
cd alternate-icons
make
make install
~~~

## Setting up your app

To set up AlternateIcons as an Xcode build phase, do the following:

1. Add your main icon to your main asset catalog.

2. Create a new Xcode asset catalog to store your icons, and **do not add it to your target**.

> **NOTE** In this example, we'll name the catalog "AlternateIcons".

3. Add your alternate app icons to this asset catalog, using the '*New iOS App Icon*' template.

4. In the Build Phases section of your project target, add a new Run Script phase. The script should be:

    ~~~
    embed-alternate-icons
    ~~~

    You now need to specify the path to the Asset Catalog you've created at step *2* under "Input Files", for example:
    
    ~~~
    $(SRCROOT)/AlternateIcons.xcassets
    $(SRCROOT)/MyApp/Info.plist
    ~~~

    Specify the Info.plist file to be written in Output Files:

    ~~~
    $(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/MyApp-Generated-Info.plist
    ~~~

    Update "Info.plist File" (`GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE`) in the app target settings (this assumes `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` is `NO`):

    ~~~
    $(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/MyApp-Generated-Info.plist
    ~~~

    **NOTE**: This Run Script phase needs to be the last build phase in your build.
    
5. Build your app.

*Et voilÃ *! All the icons have automatically been embedded into your app and are ready for use!

### Changing the icon

You can now change the icon from your code using: 

~~~swift
UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName(iconName) { error in
    // handle the result
}
~~~

Where `iconName` is the name of an icon set in your alternate icons asset catalog or `nil` if you want to return to the default icon.

## Demo

A demo project is included in the `Demo/` folder, to help you set up your app.

Make sure to [install](#installation) AlternateIcons before you build it.

## How it works

Every time you build your app, the script will perform the following steps:

1. Get the build products location from environment variables passed by Xcode
2. Parse the Asset Catalog to build a list of icons to embed
3. Copy the alternate icon files in the app bundle
4. Update the `CFBundleIcon` and `CFBundleIcon~ipad` sections of the Info.plist with the list of alternate icon file names
